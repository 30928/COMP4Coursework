\subsection{Changes to Detailed Plan}

The tests that have been removed are highlighted in gray. These were removed because they were not included in the sytem due to changes made during the deveopment of the system, as it was not possible to keep some features in the system. The tests that were changed/added are highlighted in light gray. These were changed because the functionality of the system had also been changed to make sure the system was still possible to develop, as it previously was not. The tests that were added were added because the system needed features to be tested because they were newly added to the system, or they were features that were required to be tested but I had not forseen this beforehand.

\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Approach to Testing}

I have chosen to use a range of testing strategies. For instance, series 1 of of the tests is testing the flow of control, making sure that the user navigates to the correct areas of the interface. Series 2 of the tests ensures that the validation of user inputs is performed correctly, whilst series 3 certifies that the calculations and algorithms in the system function correctly. Series 4 makes sure that the added data is stored correctly, updated data is saved to the correct tables and fields, and the deletion of data is performed on the correct data. 

\subsection{Problems Encountered}

I encountered a few minor problems whilst testing my program.

\underline{Tests 2.9 and 2.10}, Figures \ref{fig:BookInvoiceDiscountValidation} and \ref{fig:RoyaltyDiscountValidation} on pages \pageref{fig:BookInvoiceDiscountValidation} and \pageref{fig:RoyaltyDiscountValidation} respectively

These tests encountered a minor problem, where if the user were to enter an invalid value for an entry, proceed to calculate using their inputs and confirm that they wish to add it to the database, the user would be correctly prompted with an error. However, upon dismissing the error, the window that they were using to add data to the database would close, forcing them to reopen the window and start entering data again. I have a vague idea of where the problem is,  but as it isn't a serious problem for the user, this will be considered as an area for future updates. 

This is the only problem my tests encountered, which also affected a few of the tests in series 3, causing the same issue.


\subsection{Strengths of Testing}

The strengths of my testing program consisted mainly of the consistency of the flow of data, and the flow of control. This proved that there wouldn't be any problem with the navigation of the user interface, and also no problems would be encountered when interacting with the data. Also, the testing program concluded that the user was limited to certain inputs for certain fields. For example, the user was required to enter a discount for the Book Invoice Items, and was limited to being able to enter numbers alone. This is seen in the evidence for test 2.9, Figure \ref{fig:BookInvoiceDiscountValidation} on page \pageref{fig:BookInvoiceDiscountValidation}. Also, dropdown lists were used to prevent the user from incorrectly spelling certain inputs. This can be seen in a number of my examples of evidence, such as Figure \ref{fig:AddBookTest} on page \pageref{fig:AddBookTest} for test 4.2 and Figure \ref{fig:UpdateBookInvoiceItemsTest} on page \pageref{fig:UpdateBookInvoiceItems} for test 4.11. This showed that the testing program would not be limited to identifying specific errors as the user was prevented from entering incorrect data in some parts of the program.

\subsection{Weaknesses of Testing}

A weakness of my testing program was that it did not test every single component of the system. because most of the program used similar coding for its functionality. Therefore, after testing a few of the components, others were not tested because of the similar functionality. For example, a number of windows for adding, editing and deleting have a cancel button to close the window. I have only tested two of these, as I can gain the assumption that all the cancel buttons work to the required standard fromm testing to see whether these two work. This can be seen in tests 1.25 and 1.26, where I tested these cancel buttons. This means that I am unable to establish that the system is entirely robust.

\subsection{Reliability of Application}

All inputs, outputs and changes function as the should do, and as they were planned to. The system mostly prevents te user from entering inaccurate data, so that the inputs and outputs would not malfunction. Although, test 3.4 shows that a calculation would still be conducted if the user had entered a negative number, which is invalid. This happened because the calculation is conducted immediately after the user types. However, the program would not allow the user to confirm their entry with this invalid data, despite the calculations being conducted. This can be seen in the evidence for test 2.9, Figure \ref{fig:BookInvoiceDiscountValidation} on page \pageref{fig:BookInvoiceDiscountValidation} where a calculation is conducted, but the user is prompted against the invalid entry. Consequently, the system is generally reliable as it is moderately effective in preventing invalid entries.

\subsection{Robustness of Application}

The testing program used proves that the system is fairly robust. The program never encounters runtime errors or index errors, which were carefully prevented during the development of my system. Also, the system prevents invalid entries so that the program doesn't crash, as seen in the evidence for test 2.6, Figure \ref{fig:InvalidAddress} on page \pageref{fig:InvalidAddress},  and my test program did not cause my system to crash once.
