\chapter{Evaluation}

\section{Customer Requirements}

In this section I will evaluate whether I have fulfilled each objective which were set in my system specifications. This will determine whether the system meets the full customer requirements. Where the objectives may not have been met, I will evaluate and explain the reason for this being so. I will also provide evidence to prove that objectives have been met in other cases, which will determine that the system has acheived its specifications
